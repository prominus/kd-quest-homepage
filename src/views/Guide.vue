        <p class="h1">Getting started as a new player</p>
        <p>This is a guide for after the Beginner Box campaign, and entails getting ready for the Starfinder <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZF94p09siU">Adventure Path: Fly Free or Die</a>. This level 1-13
            adventure is heavily inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)">TV series
                Firefly</a>. With a strong focus on resource scarcity and making difficult choices as a crew. First thing
            to cover though: Required reading for Starfinder Core rules. </p>
        <p>The Heroes&#39; Handbook was an abridged Starfinder ruleset. To learn the full rules you will need to cover some
            sections of the Core Rulebook.</p>

        <p class="h1" id="starfinder-core-rulebook">Starfinder: Core Rulebook</p>
        <p class="h2" id="minimum-reading">Minimum reading</p>
        
        <p>Any Starfinder game can be run with the Core Rulebook alone. For Playable Characters (PCs) you should at least
            read these Chapters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 1 - Overview</li>
            <li>Chapter 5 - Skills</li>
            <li>Chapter 7 - Equipment</li>
            <li>Chapter 8 - Tactical Rules
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2" id="recommended-reading">Recommended reading</p>
        <p>I recommend at least reading the relevant parts of these chapters for your characters and character creation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 6 - Feats</li>
            <li>Chapter 7 - Equipment</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="h2" id="character-creation">Character Creation</p>
        <p>Speaking of character building: You are welcome to use the pre-generated (Pregen) Iconic Characters if you prefer
            easing into the rules/gameplay more. Or you know, just don&#39;t have the time to dedicate reading a bunch of
            material at once. </p>
        <p>If you are up for creating a a new character, then read the portions of these chapters necessary for the
            character you are envisioning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 2 - Character Creation</li>
            <li>Chapter 3 - Races</li>
            <li>Chapter 4 - Classes</li>
            <li>Chapter 13 - Pathfinder Legacy (Legacy Races: page 506)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may need to read additional chapters depending on the class/race you take. If you are using a magic-based
            character you will need to read relevant parts for choosing/using spells:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 5 - Magic and Spells</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mechanics and technology based classes will want to focus on the Equipment chapter more.</p>
        <h2 id="starship-combat">Starship Combat</h2>
        <p>The Fly Free or Die adventure path will not have spaceship combat in the first few sessions. However, spaceship
            management and combat will become important starting at level 3. At that point you should start looking at the
            Starships chapter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 9 - Starships</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="additional-starship-rules">Additional Starship Rules</h2>
        <p>The Fly Free or Die adventure path does utilize chase rules of Starship Operations Manual after level 3:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Starship Operations Manual: Chapter 2: Starship Combat: Starship Chases: page 44</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With this campaign heavily relying on space management and travel, you might want to read all of Chapter 1 and 2.
        </p>
        <h2 id="starfinder-lore">Starfinder Lore</h2>
        <p>It&#39;s up to you how much you&#39;d like to invest in learning about the Starfinder universe. The Races chapter
            in the Core Rulebook will provide you with an approach on how to roleplay your character based on other alien
            species. The Fly Free or Die dossier will also provide hooks into important Non-Playable Characters (NPCs). </p>
        <p>With that said, if you want to flesh out your PC background more then I&#39;d recommend glossing over the
            Settings chapter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 12 - Setting</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h1 id="fly-free-or-die">Fly Free or Die</h1>
        <h2 id="dossier-campaign-welcome-packet">Dossier: Campaign welcome packet</h2>
        <p>Amongst the other reading material there will be a dossier introducing the Fly Free or Die adventure path. Use
            this for recommended themes in character creation along with background hooks to significant NPCs.</p>
        <h2 id="galactic-trade">Galactic Trade</h2>
        <p>This goes hand-in-hand with the other reading material for starship management. This will be needed past level 3.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="extra-credit-reading-additional-rule-books">Extra credit: Reading additional Rule Books</h2>
        <p>There are over a dozen Starfinder books that expand on the options and lore of the Core Rulebook. All are
            optional to read with the exception of the Starship Operations Manual noted above.</p>
        <h2 id="extended-options-for-character-creation">Extended Options for Character Creation</h2>
        <h3 id="races">Races</h3>
        <p>There are over 100 playable races in Starfinder outside of the core 7 races. They can be found throughout other
            sources. These books specifically have the most.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alien Archive, Alien Archive 2, Alien Archive 3, Alien Archive 4 - Primarily, these books provide GM with
                monsters to fight. Some of these creatures come with a light blue box with Playable stats.</li>
            <li>Pact Worlds - Provides some species in the Pact World System that are not categorized as core races.</li>
            <li>Near Space - Provides species that can be found throughout the Veskarium (Vesk Empire).</li>
            <li>Interstellar Species - Has a useful chart of what playable species can be found in Starfinder, and what book
                those species were introduced.</li>
            <li>Starfinder Enhanced - Newest species added to Starfinder. Starting at page 20.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="additional-classes-and-class-options">Additional classes and class options</h3>
        <p>There are 13 official classes in total. I&#39;m noting in what book they can be originally found, although
            options for these classes can be found throughout all titles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Biohacker - Introduced in Character Operations Manual</li>

            <li>Witchwarper - Introduced in Character Operations Manual</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="look-up-classes-online">Look up classes online</h3>
        <p>While using the books for images to inspire your character&#39;s look can be useful. All information can be found
            online here: <a

        <h3 id="enhanced-classes">Enhanced Classes</h3>
        <p>The team at Paizo recently released updated rules to fix or &quot;enhance&quot; some of the classes.
        Specifically: Envoy, Solarian, Technomancer, and Witchwarper. Those updated rules can be found in the Starfinder
        Enhanced. I leave it up to the players to decide if they want to run with the updated rules or not.</p>
    <h3 id="look-up-themes">Look up themes</h3>
    <p>Themes pop up in all of the Starfinder books. While it is recommended to stick to the suggested themes in the Fly
        Free or Die Dossier, you can select any theme you think will help in the campaign: <a

    <h2 id="additional-sources-for-lore">Additional sources for Lore</h2>
    <p>Read these books if you wanted to deep dive into more factions, history, and worlds of the Starfinder Universe
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pact Worlds - Knowledge on the main solar system. </li>
        <li>Near Space - Knowledge on the Veskarium.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="note-on-starfinder-society-scenarios-and-other-adventure-paths-">Note on Starfinder Society Scenarios and
        other Adventure Paths.</h2>
    <p>You might see references to various Starfinder Scenarios or other Adventure Paths (AP) throughout the archives or
        source books. I don&#39;t intend to pull from these for now.</p>
    <h2 id="note-on-current-timeline">Note on current timeline</h2>
    <p>Some things to know in passing if you do read more into Starfinder Lore:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The current Prime Executive of Absalom Station is Kumara Melacruz.</li>
        <li>The current First Seeker of the Starfinder Society is Luwazi Elsebo.</li>
        <li>This adventure path occurs prior to the Drift Crisis. You are welcome to skip over any mention of this
            cataclysm as this won&#39;t affect the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h1 id="pacing-and-expectations">Pacing and expectations</h1>
    <p>The adventure path is relatively intense and linear during levels 1-2. After level 3 there are options for
        &quot;breather&quot; side quests, and a more dynamic storyline. While I will be relying heavily on the adventure
        path for the flow of the campaign, feel free to point out other things you&#39;d like to see show up, and I will
        do my best to weave them in!</p>
    <hr>
    <h1 id="party-dynamics">Party Dynamics</h1>
    <p>I&#39;ve skimmed over the whole adventure path. Here are some things to keep in mind without spoiling anything:
        In the early levels while you are still an EJ corp underling, the focus is more on combat and technical prowess.
        As you get to mid-level and higher-level, the focus shifts to include more to social intrigue and espionage.</p>
